## 2026-02-22 — Phase 0: Types & Skeleton

Implemented:
- Created `src/watcher/types.ts` with all four type definitions (WatchOptions, WatchHandle, WatchBatch, WatchError) mirroring the spec exactly
- Created `src/watcher/index.ts` barrel exporting functions and types
- Created `src/watcher/watch-session.ts` stub with registry Map and function signatures (throw "Not implemented")
- Created empty `src/watcher/__tests__/` directory for upcoming tests

Files changed:
- src/watcher/types.ts (new)
- src/watcher/index.ts (new)
- src/watcher/watch-session.ts (new)

Verified: typecheck passes, all 421 tests pass.
